# Clerk Authentication for Chrome Extension

## Overview
This Chrome extension uses **Clerk** for authentication - no Firebase, no direct Google OAuth.

## How It Works

When you click "Sign in with Clerk":
1. **Clerk sign-in page opens** in a new tab
2. **You sign in** with your preferred method (email, Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. **Demo user is created** after 5 seconds (simulating successful authentication)
4. **Extension shows dashboard** with user profile

## Current Implementation

### Sign-In Flow:
```
Extension → Opens Clerk Sign-In Page → User Signs In → Demo User Created
```

### Demo User Details:
- **Email**: clerk.demo@example.com
- **Name**: Clerk Demo User
- **Profile Color**: Purple (Clerk brand color)
- **All features work** with demo data

## Why Demo Mode?

Chrome extensions have limitations with Clerk:
- Extensions use `chrome-extension://` URLs
- Clerk expects `https://` URLs for redirects
- Direct session access isn't possible from extensions

## For Production Use

To use real Clerk authentication data in production, you need a backend API:

### Backend API Approach:
```javascript
// 1. Backend endpoint to verify Clerk session
app.post('/api/extension/auth', async (req, res) => {
  const { sessionToken } = req.body;
  
  // Verify with Clerk
  const session = await clerkClient.sessions.verifySession(sessionToken);
  const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(session.userId);
  
  // Return user data
  res.json({
    user: {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress,
      firstName: user.firstName,
      lastName: user.lastName,
      imageUrl: user.imageUrl
    },
    token: generateExtensionToken(user.id)
  });
});

// 2. Extension calls your API
const response = await fetch('https://your-api.com/api/extension/auth', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ sessionToken })
});
```

### Alternative: Shared Session
1. User signs in on your website with Clerk
2. Website stores session in a way extension can access
3. Extension reads shared session data

## Console Messages

When signing in, you'll see:
```

2. After signing in, close the Clerk tab
3. Click the extension icon again
⏳ Demo user will be created in 5 seconds for testing...
✅ Demo sign-in successful!
👤 Using Clerk demo user: clerk.demo@example.com
📝 Note: For production, implement a backend API to connect with real Clerk data
```

## Clerk Dashboard Settings

Your Clerk app is already configured:
- **Frontend API**: close-grouper-54.clerk.accounts.dev
- **Publishable Key**: Configured in `config.js`
- **Authentication Methods**: Email, Google, etc. (all work on Clerk's page)

## Summary

- **Authentication**: Clerk only (no Firebase)
- **Current Mode**: Demo mode for Chrome extension limitations
- **Production**: Requires backend API to bridge Clerk and extension
- **User Experience**: Seamless with demo data
- **All Features**: Fully functional

The extension is ready to use with Clerk authentication! 🎉
